### Code example for Reach

Built using Kotlin, MVVM (ViewModels & databinding), Coroutines, Retrofit for API & Realm for storage.

Update from original to get the display using a base data model, and the storage to convert from
model data to storage data - still needs testing and additional functionality added

Automation tests to follow...

I will continue working on the code to get it running properly, but it will be done after the
timeline of the test.
